v0.2.0a "Love In" (10/11/2015)
- Model created for paid accounts and teams
- A team administration page (located under settings) can be used to invite people to a team and change their roles within the team
- Accounts have "teams", "facilities" and "contacts"
- Team members can see only facilities of the accounts they are members of
- Each team member has a defined role within the team
- Team members have a profile page that can be edited
- Accounts have a contact list of "preferred contractors" (v0.3.0a+ - these preferred contractors can be selected from contractor directory)
- Accounts can have a different status depending on the level of the paid account (default status is... Founding Member? for beta)
- Users can be invited to teams
- User accounts are free, but a use must be a member of a paying team to use the software - so what do users who are not team members see? Perhaps a message like "you are not yet a member of any team - ask your team administrator to invite your - or subscribe to start your own team"
- Facilities have their own team which may include members from another account - be it another paid FM Clarity account, or a contractor account
- A facility that is created by a member of an account, by default, has that accounts members as its team - but this can be changed after facility creation
- Contractors can sign up for a special type of account. A single member contractor still has a distinction between their business entity (account) and their personal profile (user) and so is treated like a single member team.
