- Accounts can have a different status depending on the level of the paid account (default status is... Founding Member? for beta)
- Users can be invited to teams
- User accounts are free, but a use must be a member of a paying team to use the software - so what do users who are not team members see? Perhaps a message like "you are not yet a member of any team - ask your team administrator to invite your - or subscribe to start your own team"
- Facilities have their own team which may include members from another account - be it another paid FM Clarity account, or a contractor account
