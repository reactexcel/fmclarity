## Areas selector

## Services selector

## Pattern matching

## Requests

* Feature: Services management
Services storage
Service editor
- Master services list for teams
- Add facility chooser for Suppliers (this will be needed for Brisbane)
facilities - areas - drop down box expands over top of screen instead of dropping down and having a scroll. Also you cannot change an entry, only delete (not so much of an issue)

* Areas selector:
- Default supplier and area type dd in portfolio/edit services/edit area is partially hidden (I think a double check process of this happening is needed for all future new/edited dds)
- Pressing enter in the middle of services list creates duplicate of last item
- Example "identifier" or tooltip in the areas selector for ranges
- Service level agreement timeframe settings missing from contractors and default for Kaplan
- 'X' does not delete default supplier for services, no way to have no default supplier
- Even though I added Electrical as a new service, it does not appear in the listing when I try to select it for an existing or new work order
- Areas selector not refreshing on tab change
- Unable to add more than 5 rows in level selector, cannot delete current levels/unique areas
- Unique areas should be separate to levels to avoid confusion
- Area type drop down is hidden under fold
- Service type and levels dd hidden below the fold
