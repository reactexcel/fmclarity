PMP:
Reduce size of calendar to fit in screen
Include last and next event date on embedded table (not currently incl in screens)
When you open one of the services it expands very large and then does not close
Highlight the testing and tagging event to show that it is overdue
Alerts for completed and moved events
When all services are contracted, all events show on calendar colour-coded to service header. Colour code is the same colour for each service as with ABC graph
Need to allow function for user to accept or reject proposed attendance time by contractor
