# Emails & notifications

TODO: 

- Identify visual components
- Identify packages
- Email functionality should be encapsulated in one package: evaluate
- Should RBAC be included here?

## Visual components:

- Alert dropdown (React source??)
- Notification item (React source??)
- Inbox (React source)
- Message item

## Packages and modules

- Email send/recieve functionality (where??)
- RBAC with notification integration - needs to be completed

## Unfiled requests

- Changes to notifications (subtasks encl)
- Recurrent notifications required for overdue work orders including to suppliers
- Contractor emails: PDF attachment for work order (dependant on feature xxx pdf export)
- Email work orders to contain full information
- Add slack style (Blah is typing) and reactions

## Unfiled visual requests
(need to specify current visual component first)
- Tighten up layout of notification emails with header bar
- WO: Numbered shields should clear after viewing
- Comments should be vertically centred in line with avatar and slightly more space between avatar and comment
- Change font for comments so that clearly distinguishable from meta text
- Comment timestamp on right should say either "Just now!" or time stamp and then date stamp at each new date
- Too much vertical space is taken up in comments in WO. time should be on the right (which it is - a few seconds ago but then this should show days ago if mroe than 24 hrs), comment should be in the column next the name and be able to wrap. notifications should not show full text
- Comments: be able to #tag a user to draw their attention in a comment
