ABC:
Service report file upload (abc)
ABC – insert buttons - Request update from supplier, Action list, new (at top)
Include donut graph as per pdf screen attached
Reduce size of graph, include key Compliant and non-compliant. With the view on 'type' there should be no timescale on the y axis, it would show the individual items for the period specified
Same bug as with PMP when you open the services, they expand large and then do not close
Dashboard:
Add summary overview of recent comments on dash with avatars and links to the workorders
Day/week/month/3 month (add 6 month) to only show active item and then expand on hover like asana does with adding a section/task
Can there be a section for text based alerts?
Remove timeframe button from non-compliant graph (graph is showing a snapshot of now)
Add items to building overview: overdue orders, critical requests, urgent requests
On ABC graph, for day view of compliant/non-compliant items, switch to donut graph
Dashboard - Include the ability to choose from number or type (type of work request) on work request graph
Dashboard - button to move components as required (like Asana)
Dashboard - add drag & move icons to dash components
