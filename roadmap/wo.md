* Work request
- Add button for contractor follow up for all and individual WOs (see attached)
- Follow up work order should contain history of previous work order in discussion
- Reversals should not appear in open orders (only in closed orders)
- Contacts on work orders should be unique so when creator is the same as facility contact then one is removed
- Change scheduled priority icon in dd to disc rather than filled in circle
- Allow work orders to be created that don't have an area specified
- The contact card view pop over in the work order should be the same as the card view in suppliers
- Add issue date to work order table
- Should be an additional action available to send message after assignee chosen - "Assign work?"
- Follow up work order need to be highlighted more strongly - lets begin with just making follow up in caps and perhaps bold and see how that looks
- Pattern matching for WOs:
- WO:Flag duplicates by looking at previous wos
- WO Layout changes:
- Layout changes of WO including adding modal dialogues for new WOs and having descriptions as the first comment in discussion. 
- Active contractor should link to their supplier card (as should service type in settings once we set that up), 
- Include work request type, eg preventative maintenance, ad-hoc, base building, warranty, contract, no-cost - these can be top level service types
- Create xxs < 340px layout (6)
- Small - Facilities services item title fields don't wrap text next to toggle, only under it
- Reduce size of dropdown for facilities on dash
- Button to request contractor update for individual open requests and all
- Constrain wo title to a certain character count to prevent overflow

When you are in a scrollable drop down the page shouldn't scroll wiht the dropdown
Small - some column headers truncated
Small - tabs are squashed together causing a misalignment of columns and the underline (see attached)
Identify facility in H1 header next to Work requests title, then with 'all properties' selected include the facilities in the table (one facility it should be hidden)
Small view - Fit building overview to fit two or even three columns
Small/med - WO - reconfigure top information section so that it is nicely spaced in say three columns and not clumped together, avatar, priority and status to go on left as per large view
Small - Facilities - would be good to add two columns in the property details
Align facility names further left and add them to the title eg Work orders - Spring Hill
Line up the WO text elements with each other (see attached)
Remove description field and replace with discussion
Modal dialogue style editing
Service type and levels dd hidden below the fold
Remove 'no notifications' text from top of comments
Select supplier dd header visible on new draft work order prior to entering location (all other headers invisible until facility entered). Headers should progressively appear as before
Separate phone number digits into normal separations eg (03) 8767 5676, 0446 565 678, 1800 890 989 and disallow other characters same with ABN: 82 069 830 957 
Put the select team drop down proximal to the facilities drop down, perhaps above.
Enable tab to next action in WO
Make 'add new' floating action button larger, sticky, in bottom left and with a shadow in line with MDL heights
Service types should be a combination of suggestive search and combo box

* Action buttons/ workflow
- Request change button for supplier when
